The idea is to create end-to-end Analytical Data from the Source data with R-script.
R-Script Activities.
Create the information and share it in Google Drive as Repository.

SAP Analytics Cloud.
Create a Planning Model.
Create Simple Storie with Actual Data.

<b><i>Explain more deep Statistical knowledge </i></b>

Create Predictive Scenarios with different configurations and explanations.




Save the Forecast in Target Source.

Simulate an evaluation model..

It is my first project in a github.
need your patience if some time isnt clear.

Remember this project i try to explain all step need to do and allow you to see in another perspective its possible to learn and enjoy in same time.
With this i used to better way and you see all are is necessary to anderstand any point.
And if is not clear , again let me know.


Best regards
